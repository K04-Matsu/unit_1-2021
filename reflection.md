## Q1.What are the steps in the design cycle
### PLANNING 
### DESIGN 
### DEVELOPMENT 
### EVALUATION 
### IMPLEMENT

## Q2. What is the purpose of success criteria
To have a big vision of how the product will be finalized. By creating this success criteria, we can code the product alligning with that success criteria to meet the needs perfectly for the client.

## Q3. What do you understand now about computer/Computer science That you did not before UNIT 1
Throughout the process I was had a lack of detailed planning at the initial stage of the game creation. And beacuase of this, my code itself went back and forth taking so much unnecessary time. For conclusion, I have understood now that in terms of creating or coding a product, the planning is part is more valuable then the code itself.

## Q4. What do you understand now about yourself that you did not before Unit 1
As mentioned in Q3, I have struggled alot since my initial planning was not complete. And so, after finishing this Unit 1 project, I had a strong realization of how bad I was at planning and organising a timeline. 

## Q5. What worked well for you during development of Unit 1
For the overall process of creating the game, I think that the designing part worked well since I was able to create a project I have thought of with some decent quality. Talking about the code in particular, the usage of global statement worked effectively to finish the game. And for the what did not work well, third time mentioned, planning.

## Q6. A developer is responsible only for the accomplishment of the success criteria. Do you agree of disagree? defend you answer.
I do agree partially with the statement of "developer is responsible only for the accomplishment of the success criteria". By saying partially, I mean that the game or the developer itself is not just valued for meeting the success criteria. Additonally, our responsibility goes beyond depending on how influential the product and the code for it is. For example, if the product becomes famous and people imitate the code. If the imitated code makes error I think the responsibility goes not only to the imitator but also the inital coder of the imitated code.
